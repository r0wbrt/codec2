* December 27th,
	- Removed Free-Dv from project. FreeDv should be a seperate project 
	   from codec2. Thus, the source was modified to reflect this belief. 
	- Removed Asterisk and stm32 source code from codec2 source code inline
	  with the goal strip the codec2 sources down to an simple library.
